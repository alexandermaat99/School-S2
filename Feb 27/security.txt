NIST Incident Response Lifecycle Phases 
- Playbooks, general set of steps taken to handle the different types of incidents 


-- Need to detect if an incident has, or is likely to occur 
- this is called a precursor (if it might happen soon)
- incident (this might be happening right now)

Locard's Exchange Principle - Everything leaves a trace/ evidence 

3rd step of Incident Response Lifestyle
-- Classification of incident 
- Put attact in a category (DDOS, Internal Hacking, etc)
- Criticality (How timely is this affecting our big critical systms?)
- Sensativity (who do we need to tell about this? Lawyers, sensative data?) 1-3
- Inform appropriate entities (FBI?)
- Containment - keep the problem from getting worse (risk of Containment)

--Gathering Evidence (especially if there is law inforcement involvement)
-Criminals go free when evidence is messed with 
-Take image snapshot of server (hashing image) *Create a forensic image
-Keep an evidence log (who has access to this file at this certian time) *Chain of custody

--Eradication


--Recovery
-Keep a very close eye on things
